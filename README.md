## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# Make sure Semantic-UI is built at least once using now-dev (also run this anytime you change the global Semantic site.variables file)
npm run now-dev
# All times after you can use dev
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
