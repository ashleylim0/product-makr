He was one of my outstanding MBA students, and we made a real connection that has continued since his graduation. Ren√© is creative, hard-working, open-minded, and super intelligent. In addition to establishing a strong record of employment in business, he has started a number of really interesting projects geared toward helping people and improving the world. Over the past several years I have seen him grow and mature as a businessperson, focus his ideas, and create fascinating products. I highly recommend working with Ren√©. He has global experience combined with a Midwestern work ethic and kindness.\""
