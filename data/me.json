It was a great honor to start our professional careers together as interns at Verizon working cross-collaboratively in a virtual environment across the U.S. in the 2000s. René developed research and project management skills through our intern project where we had to engage with other interns on phone calls to finish leadership presentations and complete a white paper on remote work, mobility, and telecommuting. Clearly, we were 10 years ahead of the trend :) I have confidence in René's ability to manage a project working with people across regions to deliver products and results...just as he did early in his career. Can't wait to see what company is lucky to gain such a valuable asset to their organization!"
