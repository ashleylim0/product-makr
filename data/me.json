Ren√© developed research and project management skills through our intern project where we had to engage with other interns on phone calls to finish leadership presentations and complete a white paper on remote work, mobility, and telecommuting. Clearly, we were 10 years ahead of the trend :) I have confidence in Ren√©'s ability to manage a project working with people across regions to deliver products and results...just as he did early in his career. Can't wait to see what company is lucky to gain such a valuable asset to their organization!\""
