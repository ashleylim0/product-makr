title: 'About Me'
---

I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. I love to learn new things by [reading](https://goodreads.com/renedeanda "Goodreads"), listening to [podcasts](https://rede.io/what-startup-tech-podcasts/), asking lots of questions, and building new things that help others. I also love [photography](https://unsplash.com/@renedeanda "Unsplash").

I taught myself to code and [build products](/projects "projects") by watching tutorials on the internet and by just building. My most popular app is the [Delightful gratitude journal app](https://delightfuljournal.com "Delightful").

I'm from Iowa but have lived in Virginia, Illinois, California, and most recently Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for 2 years.

Family, friends, and creating things to help other people are the most important things to me. This open-source portfolio website for example was made to help [product managers easily create an online presence](https://product.makr.io "Product Makr").

# Education

# Random Goals

1. I love reading historical fiction books & dream of writing a book in this genre one day. The book I'm reading right now that I really love is [The Mountains Sing by Nguyễn Phan Quế Mai](https://smile.amazon.com/Mountains-Sing-Que-Phan-Nguyen-ebook/dp/B07WK5T9ZD "The Mountains Sing")

2. I want to keep learning new programming languages and tech stacks every year because it's fun to learn how things work and get made. For example, I recently learned some Python to automate image generation for my open-source [Tech Viet site listing Vietnamese tech companies](https://Tech.Viet.io "Vietnam Tech Ecosystem"). You can see the [Python scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/renedeanda/tech.viet/blob/master/scripts/python-scripts/scrape.py "Python Tech Viet"), it was fun to learn.

3. I've run a half-marathon in the past, I'd like to at least try running a marathon someday.

4. I can understand a bit of other languages, but I want to get better at conversing in other languages.

5. I dream of growing my own home garden one day.

# Product Stuff

## What's my favorite mobile app?

My favorite app is the Amazon Kindle app because like I mentioned before I love to read. I appreciate the weekly & daily *Reading Insights* feature that encourages me to read everyday to keep my streak alive. I also like Kindle's *Whispersync* feature that allows me to easily to switch between mobile and Kindle devices to keep reading where I left off. I also love to highlight books & output my *highlights to PDF* to read later, which as far as I know only Kindle devices allow you to send a PDF export of your highlights to an email address - it would be nice if this feature comes to the mobile apps.
